Why programming is needed?

Computer only understands only 0 and 1/ true and false called binary system.

Programming languages have generally two types.
1.Compiler (translated in advance)

Javascript is a interpreted language.

Javascript is also called Client-side-language.
Only a browser is needed to run Javascript codes.

Nodejs is a run-time environment not a programming language.
